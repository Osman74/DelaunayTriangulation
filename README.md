# DelaunayTriangulation
3D conforming Delaunay Triangulation by Advancing Front method

The idea of boundary protection can also be extended to three or higher dimensions, in which
nodes are inserted to the missing geometrical quantities until they appear in the DT of the
points. In 3D, objects are bounded by closed surfaces of triangular facets. Unlike the bound-
ary recovery of 2D domains, whose boundaries are composed of only line segments and points
can be inserted on the boundary edges without much issue of convergence, in 3D, the bound-
ary of the domain consists of edges and triangular faces (Rand and Walkington 2009).
